# Advent of code event 2021

Repository for [Advent of code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions in C++.

First time experimenting with CMake.

To build all days run

```
./build.sh --all

This will build the executables and copy them to the `dist` folder

## Run

The programs expect to find the data in `data/<day#>.dat`.
